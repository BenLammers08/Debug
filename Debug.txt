First Bug: line 111
empty set isEmpty is failing 
it is returning true when rear is greater than zero when it should be returning false

second bug: line 147
debuged in to is empty and A was being added but not printing and the method kept saying it was empty so i figued i had to increment rear in the add method
nothing was being printed in tostring because the for loop for in the tostring was going off of the rear and rear wasnt getting incremented 

third bug 
A_addB_AB_testRemoveA was going out of bounds by one because it was moving values that were the same size as rear which was was bigger than the array size so i made it search move for rear-1
